	<h2 class="wfp--story__subtitle">Funding facility allows for scale-up of emergency operation</h2>
	<p class="wfp--markup">In mid-2016, widespread inter-ethnic tensions and conflict descended on the Kasai region of
		the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), claiming countless lives and causing massive displacement. The Kasai
		crisis unfolded within a country already struggling with a protracted and underfunded emergency in the east.
		Since the emergence of the Kasai crisis, funding shortfalls proved to be a major challenge to WFP’sresponse.</p>
	<p>The scale of the food security and nutrition crisis in Kasai is immense. In September 2017, the World Food
		Programme (WFP)’s Emergency Food Security Assessment found that there were 3.2 million severely food insecure
		people in this region alone. In addition, 400,000 children are at risk of dying from severe acute malnutrition
		without urgent life-saving assistance.</p>

**Search** enables users to specify a word or a phrase to find particular relevant pieces of content without the use of navigation. Search can be used as the primary means of discovering content, or as a filter to aid the user in finding content.

### Usage with react

```js
import { Search } from '@wfp/ui';

<Search
  className="some-class"
  kind="large"
  name="input-name"
  labelText="Label"
  closeButtonLabelText="The label text for the close button (closeButtonLabelText)"
  placeHolderText="Placeholder"
  onChange={e => action('onChange')}
/>;
```

This a sample of a large table of records and a panel that combines both simple and advanced filters.  The simple filter is included in the panel header and aligned with the header title. It can work either on runtime (Type to filterâ€¦) or on enter, in which case the lope should be placed on the right and become clickable. The scope of the simple filter is limited to the data displayed in the table column, even if these are  teasers or previews of full records. The simple filter is not a search function, therefore should not be applied to search the full content of the records previewed in the table. 

The data can be highlighted as filtering is applied. 

The advanced filters panel can be displayed on demand or be open by default depending on the context and user needs. 

Input fields are laid out on **max 3 rows**, plus a fourth one reserved to the Clear and Apply buttons. 

The filters can be cumulative, i.e. additional filters can be defined and applied to a filtered list of rows obtained through the use of the simple filter.
